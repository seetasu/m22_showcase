						<h3>Vision</h3>
						<p class="para">
							At the emergence of computers and smartphones, designers and engineers tried their best to put a lot of functions into the black boxes, behind the screen. While some phenomenon that arises with the popularity of portable screen devices was criticized. Smartphone (tablets, PC) addiction has alienated people with their surroundings. More and more people are busy at fiddling with their smart devices and snubs the person sitting next to them. Letters, albums turn into online chatting history and digital photos lies in the computer. Our nimble hands, which can do tremendous works, are now interacting with screens and keyboards at most of the time.
							</br></br> 
							As I see it, technology is meant to enhance the interaction between people, instead of substituting it with interacting with the mediators. Making the interactions more lifesome, natural and embodied, enabling them to step out of the screen will become the new age. However, I didn’t mean that screens are to be discarded completely. I believe that people will interact with a connected smart environment in the future, both digitally and physically. With the advance of technology like wireless transmission and various sensors, objects equipped with intelligence and supported by virtual platform will be the realization of the combination of physical and digital worlds. Reduction on production cost, made possible by technology like 3D-printing, will facilitate fast iteration of these objects as well. Therefore, I think an Industrial Designer of the near future, will be capable of designing in and bridging both worlds, translating technologies into a systematic solution that eventually benefit people, society and nature, that bring about convenient and delightful experience, and this is the vision I had for myself, as well as how I train myself to be.
						</p>				
						<h3>Identity</h3>
						<p class="para">
							To start with, the choice to study as a designer owed to my curiosity. Design is something that brings me new experiences and fresh feelings all the time. I keep learning and trying out things that attracts me. The openness I hold towards the unknown and the unexperienced has cultivated my ability to accept and learn quickly.
							</br></br>
							Next to it, I’m a completer and finisher, both in a team or individually. I tend to start projects that I can properly finish. The details and essentials always have my attention in the design process. When working with people, instead of giving opinions eagerly, I’m used to listen first, which may lead to the misrepresentation of shyness. However, listening and observing is a process of collecting information. It is when I had sufficient comprehension that I will take action.
							</br></br>
							Experience-wise, I graduated from China Agricultural University with a Bachelor degree of Engineering in Industrial Design, after which I worked as a graphic designer for one year before I came to TU/e. The personal history has awarded me the forte and love for graphic design, form and senses, colour and materials. I’m also good at physical prototyping, although electronics are what blocks me in the way of making functional products right now, therefore I’ll put more efforts in this area.

							<h1>FMP</h1>
							<h3>Brief</h3>
							<p class="para">
								Behavioural domestic energy conservation is a tricky problem because it does not stand in the front row in our concerns when people stay in their homes. As big as insulate the house or as small as turn off the light when absent, the factors that halt people 's behaviours towards green living can be concluded into two aspects: inconvenience in control and incorrect cognition.
								</br></br>
								This project proposes to couple the energy information with action possibilities of household appliances in a smart home context, aiming at achieving conscious energy behaviours and lowering the complexity of smart home control system at the same time. The eco-visualization employing ferrofluid mimics a small creature, whose vitality is enslaved to daily energy consumption. Users are enabled to manipulate and react to this Electricity pet's behaviour and therefore give commands to their appliances. 

							</p>
							<h3>Reflection</h3>
							<p class="para">
								The FMP is a project with intensive desk research and hands-on prototyping. I was impressed at the beginning of FMP, and also in my previous objects, when I saw the fantastic projects and research done by wonderful people. But one thing seldom come to my mind is what is the necessity of researching certain topic. Especially MIT media lab. As an outstanding organization, they studied on all kinds of media that can be used to express information and serve as engaging interfaces. When I was reading the papers time and time again, actually making ferrofluid display, I came to know the reasons. Information carrier is a crucial elements in designing for tangible user interface. TUI must be expressive constantly, so the meaning it communicates will be changing. Especially when it is used in a growing system. LEDs are used widely as a means here. Since they are cheap and can be programmed easily. So find out matter that can be programmed individually as pixels do on the screens is a tough yet significant direction. As I experienced it, I think ferrofluid as a media for TUI is greatly promising. By coding the behaviour of ferrofluid, playing with the shape of magnets, distances between magnets and ferrofluid, it has a great richness.
								</br></br>---------------------</br></br>
								What Tangible User Interface addresses is to employ user’s cognitive skills, emotion skills and perceptual-motor skills in a comprehensive way. Among them, cognitive skills can be used very often and sometime too much. To teach users how to use something by setting users a list of “rules” (dozens of patterns vs. dozens of message). This happens quite often in designs with LEDs and shape-changing interfaces. And I think they are sometimes a solution because of designer’s being “lazy”. LEDS, voice control, shape-changing interfaces are three leading interactions existing respectively in current market, future market and academic field. I, as both a designer and a user, could not depict a world with only anyone of them. Therefore, what I could do in my design, is try my best to avoid heavy cognition burden, making use of diverse interactions and skills, in order to provide a better user experience. 
								</br></br>---------------------</br></br>
								I had a summer internship at Duneworks (see details in the showcase), during which I developed an interactive stakeholder map webpage for one of their project. In the following semester, the feasibility study about smart plug was conducted. This led to that I’ve encountered a great deal of front-end technologies in the past 6 months. Therefore the competence of Technology and Realization is substantially improved. It’s a chance for me to learn a lot of front-end knowledges, think about it and its importance in designing for smart homes. 
								</br></br>
								Front-ends is normally referring to the presentation layer of a webpage. While I think it is also an applicable term to be used in IoT field, after all each smart object is just another client to the server. I spent a lot of time to read about HTTP protocols of Plugwise, trying to understand Node.js, just to bring the data of Plugwise to the front-end, to be used on El. There were a lot of barriers on the road. All the complexity is owned to the enclosed system of the smart plugs.
								</br></br>
								Smart plugs are the most efficient and basic means to intelligentialize your home, since it gives normal appliances a schedule and a remote switch. If these plugs can be made with more openness, with more APIs (Application Programme Interfaces), plus a flexible bridge like IFTTT (If This Then That), it will be easier for the users, to customize their life at a lower cost. All these great opportunities are there, and made me even more interested in smart home industry. I feel very challenging yet I’m expecting to continuously learning about it in the future.

							<h1>Summer Intern</h1>
							<img src="img/summerintern.jpg" class="section_header">
							<p class="para">
								Duneworks is a consultancy company that provides research and advice for sustainable innovation from societal and behavioural aspects. As an external expert of my FMP, Duneworks kept me accompanied throughout the entire project with professional knowledges and constructive feedbacks. There was an ongoing discussion with Duneworks about involving my FMP in one of their cooperation with the municipality of Eindhoven on officer energy-saving movement. But after second thoughts about the disparity of energy-saving in household and office environment, and the pros/cons of redirecting to office environment, this involvement was put aside. 
								</br></br>
								In addition, they offered me a chance to participate in one of their project, DR BoB (<a href="www.dr_bob.eu">www.dr-bob.eu</a>), during the summer holidays. DR BoB (Demand Response in Blocks of Buildings) is a multi-stakeholder project whose purpose is to actualize fair use of energy in blocks of buildings like universities and hospitals through easing the peak demands and integrating renewables. A key point of a transnational cooperation as big as is the smooth communication and consensus between stakeholders. They need some common visual languages to communicate with, and to comprehend each other more timely and correctly. Therefore I developed an interactive visualization website to clarify the social, virtual and physical elements in DR BoB. Compared with the old static version, in which the elements were mixed and blended, the new visualization distinguishes the elements with their common features and presents them in three layers. The form of website makes it accessible for every parties in most of the scenarios. 
								</br></br>
								The entire process was completed with frequent feedback sessions with colleagues and DR BoB consortium. And the end result were acknowledged and appreciated by the Duneworks and the consortium. 
								</br></br>
								In this summer intern, I’ve applied design thinking and the rapid iterative design process I learned at the ID department to filed. They turned out to be very advantageous in solving complex and problematic problems, especially when the problem itself is not completely settled (as described in the feedback). Front-end knowledges were picked-up and it was a nice preparation for the M2.2 semester. Apart from this, a salutary collaboration was established with Duneworks, and there’s an intention of continuing the relationship from both of us, I’m glad to further develop DR BoB with Duneworks and being involved in more projects in the coming future.

							<h3>Creativity & Aesthetics</h3>
							<img src="img/CA.jpg" class="section_header">
							<p class="para">
								Creativity and aesthetics was developed in most of the projects, as well as in daily life. I was trained a lot in this areas before I came here. And this competence was often praised in the feedbacks of projects and electives. What I learned here, on the one hand, is to express my creativity and feeling for aesthetics through all sorts of tools and to turn them into something meaningful for the users. 
								</br></br>
								On the other hand, I found balance between aesthetics and functions. 2 years ago, I realised design was not just about the appearance so I started my master. There’re times when I switched my focus completely to how to design for users and abandoned the most fundamental element – beauty. But I adjusted the directions timely, in line with the feedbacks from my coaches. And they are put back into my designs now, my identity as a designer, my opinions towards aesthetics are expressed along with the users’ needs as an entirety in my design.

						<div class="section section_tr">
							<h3>Technology & Realization</h3>
							<img src="img/tr.jpg" class="section_header">
							<p class="para">
								My ability in making physical and digital prototypes were complemented and extended. Graphical and 3D modelling, game-making, front-end skills and electronics was greatly developed. Electronics among all of them can be seen as the biggest progress. It was a result of constantly practice in all sorts of learning activities driven by my vision of designing tangibility. My FMP is a good demonstration of designing with multidiscipline technology. I’m capable of reading datasheet and make reasonable choice of electronic component for my prototype now and this technology part is where I was told to improve on three years ago in my offer letter from TU/e. 
								</br></br>
								Apart from the formal practical skills, I was also affected by the hands-on approach of dirty prototyping. I really appreciate the mind-set of making prototype with things lying around. It accelerates the process and liberates my mind to catch a sparkle of that moment. I get the chance to experiments with materials and forms, some very nice ideas came from doing so. 
							</p>
						</div>

						<div class="section section_us">
							<h3>User & Society</h3>
							<img src="img/us.jpg" class="section_header">
							<p class="para">
								Users were almost neither defined nor reached in my Bachelor study. The human was only emphasized in ergonomics sense. But my empathy for users was greatly improved in the two and half years. Users and their need are shaping my design instead the other way around now. Back in the M1.1 project, a gesture sensor was used as an input, regardless of the fact that how inconvenient the interaction was. This situation was improved step by step when I involved users in the process, and design for them in their societal and cultural context.
								</br></br>
								The methods to get in touch with users, and understand users were also picked up in the electives and further practiced in projects. To observe from a distance in the 3rd perspective, to listen and talk to side by side in the 2nd perspective, and to experience in the shoes in the 1st perspectives, these approaches were applied flexibly in response to respective design phases. They benefit and substantialize my works. 
							</p>
						</div>

						<div class="section section_be">
							<h3>Business & Entrepreneurship</h3>
							<img src="img/BE.jpg" class="section_header">
							<p class="para">
								I had my first contact with business here in an elective cooperating with Philips, and then I learned about what need to be done to turn innovations and concepts into business. At the same time, I also educated myself with books about business models and economic paradigms. The relations of design and business from companies perspective is what I thought about most. A product is important to a company, but what matters more is how this product fits into the product line of the corporation. A good product ecosystem will attract more users and make the company competitive among others. This will make a big difference especially for IoT industry. Either expand yourself to be big enough or to be open for collaborations with other small companies, these are the two ways as I see it to stood up in the coming IoT era.  
							</p>
						</div>

						<div class="section section_mdc">
							<h3>Math,Data & Computing</h3>
							<img src="img/mdc.jpg" class="section_header">
							<p class="para">
								This expertise area was not developed specifically except for one elective about analysing experiment data, during which I had my first contact with statistics. And I found it is of great value in user research and design evaluation. By modelling the collected data, I can not only know what happens in the data, but also have a glance at the likelihood of what will happen in the future. Sometimes statistics even reveals how I can get certain results by adjusting conditions. They are really powerful tools in the future. 
								</br></br>
								In addition, mathematic thinking was also practiced a lot when coding with Processing, Arduino and JavaScript. Algorithms, arrays, math operations helped me create beautiful patterns, store data and give commands in my projects and electives. Simple use of Boolean and counter impressed me and I’m glad to boost my design with more knowledge on this area. 
							</p>
						</div>

						<div class="section section_tc">
							<h3>Teamwork & Communication</h3>
							<img src="img/tc.jpg" class="section_header">
							<p class="para">
								I used to have troubles of communicating properly and discussing actively in groups in the beginning. And I only talked to people I knew or were familiar with. But gradually, I started to know more people, and I was accustomed to the straightness of Dutch culture. So I adapted myself to the way they communicated, the way they stood out and spoke for their own ideas in the discussion. We questioned each other to consolidate our concepts and the atmosphere were quite nice. During the FMP, I can already ask for help from stranger students, professors, and external experts. At the same time, I also lent my knowledge to other students, I feel great about the mutual contacts. The summer intern gave me another chance to know about professional environment in the Netherlands, and the delight experience with colleagues encourages me to go further in my career and try to blend in.  
							</p>
						</div>

						<div class="section section_sdl">
							<h3>Self-directed & Continuous Learning</h3>
							<img src="img/sdl.jpg" class="section_header">
							<p class="para">
								The self-directed and self-learning method was totally different from what I was educated. I asked myself what is the input for designers at the M1.1 semester since I felt like I’ve been outputting in the projects and electives but seems I didn’t get things back. While soon I understood the role and meaning of reflection in this system. It is a chance for me to communicate with earlier myself. Industrial Design is a highly applied disciplines. The knowledge and barriers for every projects are different. Only by comparing with myself can I know how I’ve grown up and what’s requires more attention next time. Writing working diaries is a good way to keep this communication. By reading books and auditing at bachelor courses, I prepare myself for challenges. Other activities like making portfolio, job hunting, joining hackathon and starting-up with friends are all salutary and precious experience of embracing the unknown and possibilities. I’ll keep this active-learning mind-set for the long roads to come. 
							</p>
						</div>

						<div class="section section_drp">
							<h3>Design & Research Process</h3>
							<img src="img/drp.jpg" class="section_header">
							<p class="para">
								Design and research puzzled me in the M1.1 research semester. I had troubles of positioning research in my project. After practicing with the help from coaches, and the elective Constructive Design Research, I am able to find establish the relation between design and research correctly and applied them in the FMP. I designed to gain knowledge, and research results supported my design in return. The whole process is facilitated by self-reflecting and evaluating. By frequently looking at myself, and listening to how other people looks at my design, I kept myself on the right track. 
								</br></br>
								Methodology wise, I needed to check books like Universal Methods of Design for what kind of methods can I use in the process at first. While now I’ve had an idea ahead of time of what’s suitable for respective situations. Switching between perspectives, low-fi and high-fi prototypes, qualitative and quantitative approaches diversifies the process, and they all contribute to the sensible, grounded, and well-supported design solution in the end.

					</div>

					<div class="section section_fu" id="future" style="min-height: 100vh">
						<h2 class="cw">Future</h2>
						<p class="para">
							As wrote in my report and scattered in the showcase, I’ve had a aim for the coming years. My interest in designing tangible products has never changed for a long time, but now smart products, especially IoT related products attracts me most. So I’ll start job hunting after graduation in Netherlands, since I think there’s a more mature market here and I enjoyed the innovative atmosphere in this country. But I’m also open for other kinds of job opportunities such as front-end engineers. The cooperation with Duneworks is likely to continue and that would be a very nice thing to do during the job hunting time. 
							</br></br>
							In a few years, I will go back to China to continue my career, but multi-cultural and international teams will still be my first choice, guess that’s who I am, always longing for new experiences, and curious about the world.
